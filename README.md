Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption Developed a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. Where you can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. It allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
The Python script provides functionalities to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple encryption algorithm based on XOR operation. It also allows users to swap the RGB values of pixels in an image.

# Functionality
1. <b>Encryption:</b> Encrypts an image using a provided encryption key.
2. <b>Decryption:</b> Decrypts an encryped image using the corresponding decryption key.
3. <b>Pixels Swapping:</b> Swaps the RGB values of pixels in an image.
4. <b>User Interaction:</b> The script prompts the user to choose between encryption,decryption,pixel swapping or exiting the program.

# Usage
1. <b>Encrypting a Image:</b> Run the script and choose the encryption option. Enter the path to the image file and the encryption key when prompted. The encrypted image will be displayed.
2. <b>Decrypting Image:</b> Choose the decryption option, enter the decryption key and the original image will be displayed if the decryption is successful.
3. <b>Swapping Pixels:</b> Select the option to swap pixels and the image with swapped RGB values will be displayed.
4. <b>Exiting the Program:</b> Choose the exit option to terminate the program.
